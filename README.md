# Natours_advanced_css
based on advanced css course on Udemy by Jonas schmedtmann

** This is my first project on my journey to learning Front-end development. I started this path 3 months ago and this project took me a month to complete while simultaneously learning the required skills.  I am sharing this right now because I recently learned to use github :)

# About the COMMENTS
you will notice many comments in the code, beacause I wrote them while learning to remind me good points that I have learned. I’ve kept them as they are to reflect the raw, authentic progress I’ve made. Looking back at them one day, I hope to remember the effort and time I invested in this journey.
